## My  Cookbook


## Objective
The Cookbook provides a convenient way to store, display, and navigate recipes

## Display
Each recipe is displayed as a page with steps and ingredients seperate but visible without frustrating scrolling 
Steps relating to various sub-parts (like pie crust or filling) can be isolated so working on any sub-recipe is 
visually easy to follow

## Searching 
Searching for recipes is made easy with the Cookbook beyond just searching by name

Easy to use tags in the navigation bar pull up all recipes with the same tag, to provide convinient
ways to select an existing recipe to use for any occasion. 
By-ingredient search is a great way to find a recipe to use up any target ingredient in the fridge 

## Notes
Make side notes apart from the recipe steps as experience and nuance builds, like the scribbles in the margins of your family's cookbook.

## Future Development Goals
SPhoto album - Save wondeful memories of meals in a scrollable album 
Share with friends - allow friends access to your recipes, including visibility any notes you have added to the recipe
